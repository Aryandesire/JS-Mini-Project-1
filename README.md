Tic-tac-toe, noughts and crosses, or Xs and Os/“X’y O’sies”, is a paper-and-pencil game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3×3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a diagonal, horizontal, or vertical row is the winner.

 #### How to get started
Tic-Tac-Toe is a simple game for two players that we enjoyed playing as kids (especially in boring classrooms). The game involves 2 players placing their respective symbols in a 3x3 grid. The player who manages to place three of their symbols in horizontal/vertical/diagonal row wins the game. If either player fails to do so the game ends in a draw. If both the people always play their optimal strategies the game always ends in a draw.
